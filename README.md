In this assignment, you will implement ray casting algorithm.

Follow the lecture content,  write a program to generate the ray casting result.

The objects in the scene are spheres.  You need to define in your program:

the light source intensity (R, G, B),
 light source location (Lx, Ly, Lz),
 eye location (Ex, Ey, Ez),
 at least 2 spheres,
 location/radius of spheres,

surface property (K value in the lighting model),  view plane size/location/orientation (perpendicular to  one axis)

Your result should be showing 2 shaded spheres (or more),  with one sphere casting a shadow on the other

( after your program works, just change the sphere location or light location to get shadow)




ground plane is optional.  Reflection and refraction are optional.




A diagram image is provided for your reference.




Write comment to explain your code.
